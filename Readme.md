# LaTeX CV Builder

This repository demonstrates a LaTeX CV template with **multiple build methods**, providing flexibility and redundancy across different platforms and workflows.

## Why Multiple Build Methods?

Having multiple ways to build the same document provides several key benefits:

- **Redundancy**: If one method fails, you can easily switch to another
- **Platform Independence**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Flexibility**: Choose the approach that fits your environment and needs
- **Team Compatibility**: Different team members can use different methods

## Build Methods Comparison

| Build Method | Advantages | Disadvantages | Best For |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|
| **Local** | - Fast compilation<br>- Direct feedback<br>- No internet required<br>- Full editor integration | - Requires LaTeX installation<br>- Environment setup needed<br>- OS-dependent | Daily development<br>Frequent edits<br>Personal projects |
| **Docker** | - Consistent environment<br>- No local LaTeX install<br>- Works across platforms<br>- Reproducible builds | - Requires Docker<br>- Slower initial setup<br>- Container overhead | Team projects<br>Complex documents<br>Environment isolation |
| **GitHub Actions** | - Fully automated<br>- Continuous integration<br>- PDF release management<br>- No local setup | - Requires internet<br>- Not for frequent iteration<br>- GitHub dependency | Production builds<br>Public sharing<br>Version control |

## Build Method Documentation

Each build method has its own detailed guide:

1. **[Local Build](./Readme-Local.md)** - Build directly on your machine using VSCode/Cursor and LaTeX Workshop
2. **[Docker Build](./Readme-Docker.md)** - Build using Docker without installing LaTeX locally
3. **[GitHub Actions](./Readme-GitHub-Actions.md)** - Automated builds and releases with GitHub Actions

## Configuration Scripts

This repository includes utility scripts to simplify setup:

- `config_vscode_local.py` - Creates `.vscode/settings.json` for local LaTeX development
- `config_vscode_devcontainer.py` - Creates `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` for Docker-based development
- `docker_build.py` - Cross-platform Python script to build with Docker
- `docker_build.sh` - Shell script for Docker builds (Unix-based systems)

The inclusion of both Python and shell scripts provides redundancy across platforms:
- Python scripts work on all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Shell scripts provide native performance on Unix-based systems
- Multiple tools ensure you can always build your CV, regardless of your environment

### Usage

```bash
# Configure VSCode for local builds
python config_vscode_local.py

# Configure VSCode DevContainer
python config_vscode_devcontainer.py

# Build with Docker (Python script - cross-platform)
python docker_build.py

# Build with Docker (Shell script - Unix systems)
./docker_build.sh
```
